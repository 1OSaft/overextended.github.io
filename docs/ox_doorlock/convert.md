# Door Conversion

Door configuration files written for nui_doorlock (and its fork, qb-doorlock) can be automatically added to your MySQL database.

- Any files with the `.lua` extension placed in the `ox_doorlock/convert` directory will be read on resource start.
- Conversion cannot be guaranteed, especially if the config was not written for nui_doorlock.
