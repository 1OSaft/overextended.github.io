## Dependecies

### OxMySQL

We utilise our own resource to communicate with MySQL databases via the node-mysql2 package.
The backend is actively maintained and updated unlike the package used by mysql-async, providing improved performance, security, and features.
We provide full backwards compatibility with mysql-async and build for the current Cfx architecture.
